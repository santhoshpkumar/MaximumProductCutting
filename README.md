# MaximumProductCutting
Given a rope of length n meters, write an algorithm to cut the rope in such a way that product of different lengths of rope is maximum. At least one cut has to be made.


Example:

    •	Rope length: 2 
    •	Options: (1*1)
    •	Maximum Product Cutting : 1*1 = 1
    
    •	Rope length: 3 
    •	Options: (1*1*1, 2*1)
    •	Maximum Product Cutting : 2*1 = 2
    
    •	Rope length: 4 
    •	Options: (1*1*1*1, 2*1*1, 3*1, 2*2)
    •	Maximum Product Cutting : 2*2 = 4
    
    •	Rope length: 5 
    •	Options: (1*1*1*1*1, 2*1*1*1, 3*1*1, 2*2*1, 3*2)
    •	Maximum Product Cutting : 3*2 = 2
